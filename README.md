# Analysis of Text Complaints Using NLP Techniques

This repository hosts a data analysis project aimed at analysing negative
reviews of a mobile application. Utilising a comprehensive dataset, this project 
involves a Jupyter notebook that details the creation and optimization of 
various analytic tools used to produce certain conclusions about the examined
dataset.

## ðŸ“‹ Preliminary Information
